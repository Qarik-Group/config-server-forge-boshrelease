# credentials.yml is the means to communicate credentials
# and connection information to cf applications, when they
# bind your service to their applications.
#
# Blacksmith will `spruce merge` this file with:
#  - The full BOSH deployment manifest
#  - A file with the IP addresses for each BOSH instance.
#
# For example, if you have a job named `xyzzy', and you
# need to pass back the IP address of the first instance to
# bound applications, you could do this:
#
#    ---
#    credentials:
#      host: (( grab jobs.xyzzy/0.ips[0] ))
#
credentials: 
  host: (( grab jobs.docker/0.ips[0] ))
  uri: (( concat "https://" credentials.host ))
  username: (( grab meta.basic_auth.username ))
  password:  (( grab meta.basic_auth.password ))
  client_id: (( grab meta.basic_auth.username ))
  client_secret:  (( grab meta.basic_auth.password ))
  access_token_uri: https://uaa.example.com
